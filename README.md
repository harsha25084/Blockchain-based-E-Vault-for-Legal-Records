# Blockchain-Based E-Vault for Legal Records

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Blockchain-Based E-Vault** system designed to securely store and manage legal records such as contracts, deeds, court orders, and other sensitive documentation. By leveraging blockchain's inherent properties — **immutability, decentralization, and transparency** — the system ensures tamper-proof, auditable, and secure storage of legal data.

## 💡 Key Features

- 🔒 **Secure Document Storage:** All records are stored with cryptographic hashes and recorded on the Ethereum blockchain.
- 🧾 **Smart Contract Integration:** Smart contracts govern document verification, access, and modification.
- 👥 **Role-Based Access Control:** Only authorized entities like admins or legal professionals can upload or modify documents.
- 🔍 **Audit Trail:** All actions are timestamped and logged on-chain for traceability.
- 🌐 **Web-Based Interface:** Frontend built using Python and web technologies for easy interaction with the system.
- 🧠 **Python Blockchain Interface:** Backend Python scripts interact with deployed smart contracts.
